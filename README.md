# nf-hello plugin

This project shows how to implement a simple Nextflow plugin named `nf-hello` which intercepts workflow execution events to print a message when the execution starts and on workflow completion.

The `nf-hello` plugin also enriches the `channel` object with a `producer` and `consumer` method (`sayHello` and `goodbye`) which can be used in a pipeline script.

## Plugin Assets

- `settings.gradle`

    Gradle project settings.

- `plugins/nf-hello`

    The plugin implementation base directory.

- `plugins/nf-hello/build.gradle`

    Plugin Gradle build file. Project dependencies should be added here.

- `plugins/nf-hello/src/resources/META-INF/MANIFEST.MF`

    Manifest file defining the plugin attributes e.g. name, version, etc. The attribute `Plugin-Class` declares the plugin main class. This class should extend the base class `nextflow.plugin.BasePlugin` e.g. `nextflow.hello.HelloPlugin`.

- `plugins/nf-hello/src/resources/META-INF/extensions.idx`

    This file declares one or more extension classes provided by the plugin. Each line should contain the fully qualified name of a Java class that implements the `org.pf4j.ExtensionPoint` interface (or a sub-interface).

- `plugins/nf-hello/src/main`

    The plugin implementation sources.

- `plugins/nf-hello/src/test`

    The plugin unit tests.

## `ExtensionPoint`s

`ExtensionPoint` is the basic interface which uses nextflow-core to integrate plugins into it. It's only a basic interface and serves as starting point for more specialized extensions.

Among others, nextflow-core integrates the following sub `ExtensionPoint`s:

- `TraceObserverFactory` to provide a list of `TraceObserver`s
- `ChannelExtensionPoint` to enrich the `channel` object with custom methods

In this plugin you can find an example for each of these types.

## Unit testing

Run the following command in the project root directory (ie. where the file `settings.gradle` is located):

```bash
./gradlew check
```

## Testing and debugging

To run and test the plugin in a development environment, configure a local Nextflow build with the following steps:

1. Clone the Nextflow repository in your computer into a sibling directory:
    ```bash
    git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/nextflow-io/nextflow ../nextflow
    ```

2. Configure the plugin build to use the local Nextflow code:
    ```bash
    echo "includeBuild('../nextflow')" >> settings.gradle
    ```

   (Make sure to not add it more than once!)

3. Compile the plugin alongside the Nextflow code:
    ```bash
    ./gradlew compileGroovy
    ./gradlew exportClasspath
    ```

4. Run Nextflow with the plugin, using `./launch.sh` as a drop-in replacement for the `nextflow` command, and adding the option `-plugins nf-hello` to load the plugin:
    ```bash
    ./launch.sh run nextflow-io/hello -plugins nf-hello
    ```

## Package, upload and publish

The project should be hosted in a GitHub repository whose name should match the name of the plugin, that is the name of the directory in the `plugins` folder (e.g. `nf-hello`).

Follow these steps to package, upload and publish the plugin:

1. Create a file named `gradle.properties` in the project root containing the following attributes (this file should not be committed to Git):

   * `github_organization`: the GitHub organisation where the plugin repository is hosted.
   * `github_username`: The GitHub username granting access to the plugin repository.
   * `github_access_token`: The GitHub access token required to upload and commit changes to the plugin repository.
   * `github_commit_email`: The email address associated with your GitHub account.

2. Use the following command to package and create a release for your plugin on GitHub:
    ```bash
    ./gradlew :plugins:nf-hello:upload
    ```

3. Create a pull request against [nextflow-io/plugins](https://github.com/nextflow-io/plugins/blob/main/plugins.json) to make the plugin accessible to Nextflow.
